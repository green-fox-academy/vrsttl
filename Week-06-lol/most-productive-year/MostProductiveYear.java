public class MostProductiveYear {
  
  /**
   * Write a method that helps you find the most productive year for a film studio.
   * The method should take one argument, which is the name of the film studio.
   * The method should try to open the related data file named `studioname`.csv,
   * which is a comma separated file with 3 columns: name of the movie, release year, director
   *
   *  - If we do not have any data about the studio, the method should return an error message.
   *  - If we have found data, the method should return an information message about the most productive year for that studio.
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * If we call the method with 'marvel':
   * should return 'marvel has made the most movies in 2017.'
   *
   * If we call the method with 'ghibli':
   * should print 'Cannot find studio, please try again later.'
   *
   * Hint:
   *  - You can find some example files in this folder (marvel.csv and paramount.csv)
   *  - Most productive year: The year in which the studio has made the most movies.
