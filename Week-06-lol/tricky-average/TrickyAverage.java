public class TrickyAverage {
  /**
   * Create and test a function called `getTrickyAvg` that takes a number array (only integers) as parameter
   * and returns the average of the smallest odd and largest even.
   *  - use only basic control flow statements, like 'for', 'if', etc.
   *  - do not use built-in methods like 'filter', 'forEach', 'map', etc.
   *  - write test for 2 different scenarios (test file is provided: TrickyAverageTest.java)
   * 
   * Example cases:
   * [1, 2, 3] -> should return 1.5
   * [3, 4, 5, 6] -> should return 4.5
   * [5, 2, 8, -1] -> should return 3.5
